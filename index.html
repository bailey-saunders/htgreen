                Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than
                the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution
                to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.

                <br>
                Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but
                has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate
                boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the
                range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as
                home heating.
                <br>
                <br>
                Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the
                earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels.
                As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming
                if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.
